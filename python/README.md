# Python Implementations
This directory contains Python implementations of algorithms that solve path queries and related problems.

The solutions include context-free path query evaluation engines (`cfpq.py` script) and formal-language-constrained graph minimization engines (`graphmin.py` script).
You can find instructions on how to run those programs in their respective Python script.

It is necessary to install some requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## How to Run Tests
In this folder, run
```
python -m unittest
```

It will automaticaly discover tests in subfolders.
